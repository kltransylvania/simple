  If you want to give flowers to someone, be careful of how many flowers you give. Even numbers are for the deceased,
  so you might want to choose an odd number of flowers. <p>When you're visiting someone on first of Jan, you need to take something with you when
  entering the house and if you are a couple it's customary that man goes first then woman, otherwise it can bring bad luck on the house.</p>
 <p> When i was a child and when i was walking on the road and suddenly a black cat would cross the street in front of me i would turne around in 180 degrees quickly
  to avoid bad luck.</p>
  
  <p>When it comes to going to a baptism or wedding, people are very generous with the gifts. The family members and the godparents give the most which means
  the sum equals to the minimal wage earned in Romania. These invitations can cause unconfortable situation to many families but those who can
easily afford a wedding invitation, are happy to attend it and just have fun.</p>
