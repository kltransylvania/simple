<p><strong>Some may think Transylvania is fictional, but this central Romanian region is a real place and it’s beautiful, we can say special too.
  When you think of Transylvania the first thing that pops into your mind is probably Dracula. 
  Bram Stoker’s 1897 vampire novel was inspired by centuries-old superstition and the real-life exploits of Vlad Dracula. Known by his murderous moniker, Vlad Ţepeş (the Impaler),
  the 15th-century Wallachian nobleman was said to have skewered up to 80,000 enemies on long spikes.<br/>
  But let's leave this terrifying side of Transylvania behind and focus on it's beauty.
  Travelling around Transylvania, described as ‘the last truly medieval landscape in Europe’, feels like you’ve gone back 100 years. Horse-drawn carts rumble along dirt roads,
  while shepherds tend their flocks and villagers make hay in the sunshine.
  If you want to explore the countryside, you need to hire a car.<br/><br/>
  <b>IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THE NATURE, DON'T GO FAR FROM CITIES, VILLAGES OR TOURIST PLACES. THERE ARE AROUND 6000 BROWN BEARS LIVE IN ROMANIA AND YES, SOMETIMES THEY ATTACK PEOPLE.</b><br/>
  <h3><span style="color: #FA0909">If you rent a car you need to be very careful on the road, because majority of drivers in this country drive dangerously, there are fatal accidents on Romanian roads every single day.</span></h3>
<h3>What should you visit?</h3>
It depends if you like architecture and history then you should visit the cities such as Cluj Napoca, Sighisoara, Sibiu, Brasov, Hunedoara, Timisoara.
Otherwise you can visit Bran Castle(Dracula's Castle) and while you are there you can also visit the Bear Sanctuary in Zarnesti which is not far from Bran.<strong></p>

<u>RED LAKE</u>
<br/>
<br/>
Red Lake is a natural dam lake in Harghita County, Romania. It is located in the Hășmaș Mountains, on the upper course of the Bicaz River, and lies at the foot of the Hășmașul Mare Peak [ro], near the Bicaz Gorge, at a distance of 26 km (16 mi) from Gheorgheni and 30 km (19 mi) from Bicaz.

The lake formed following the collapse of a slope due to the earthquake of January 23, 1838 at 18:45, measuring 6.9 magnitude on the Richter scale, VIII intensity. The landslide blocked the course of the Bicaz River and the lake formed behind this dam
